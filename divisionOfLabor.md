## Andrew
* line length detection tool
  * v1 complete
  * working on chb01_03.edf at ~100s lag
* total area detection tool
  * v1 complete
* found dataset to use
  * http://www.physionet.org/pn6/chbmit/

## Ali
* simulate ECoG data
  * EEG data set was found by Andrew
* explore Simulink strategy
  * missing cortical and sensory inputs. Cannot be completed before Tuesday
* frequency detection tool
  * v1 complete
* pulse generator tool
  * v1 complete, untested
* power point presentation
  * presentation started, all figures added
  * normal phys
  * patho phys

## Shayan


## Unassigned
* ~~find ECoG data for seizures~~
* frequency/amplitude detection tool
* GUI design
* stimulation generation
* setting stimulation parameters based on user input
  * similar to how a clinician would increase values and set nominal settings to prevent false positive detections
* measure false positives, true positives, and false negatives
  * true negatives would just be no stim during regular ECoG
  
 ## Presentation
 * Background
 * Current Implantable Devices
 * Future Directions
